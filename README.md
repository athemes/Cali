In development.

## IMPORTANT!
Curent themes includes teamplate and template-part files with static HTML. Those are used for reference only. Should be deleted after development is done.
Only Styleguide file could be saved, as a feature. But the content of it needs to be added in the demo content.

Production image folder - dev-img. Remove after development.
